# Contributing to Slush

seeing as it's really just me (jacobmealey) here, I'm happy if any one is interested in contributing.

## Guidelines
- Open an issue if you find one, be detailed in your explanation but there is no need to be overly verbose. Detailed and to the point!
- Open a pull request if you have changes you like to see merged in
  - If there is an issue just add `fixes #123` (or whatever the issue number is)
  - If there is _not_ an issue, describe what the issue you are trying to solve is.
  - Explain at a high-level what the approach you took is, especially if it deviates from existing patterns and constructs.


Thank you for your interest in contributing to slush, hopefully we will see you in the issues and PRs!
